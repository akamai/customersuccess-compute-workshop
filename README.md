### Overview

![workshop](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19197357/184126261-b94fbec5-a05d-4068-b8f1-3d00fd92fc00.png)

The scenario is written to approximate deployment of a resillient, multi-region application for use in a failover or other situation where it would be necessary to serve from an alternate origin.

The workshop scenario builds the following components and steps-

1. A Secure Shell Linode (provisioned via the Linode Cloud Manager GUI) to serve as the command console for the envirnoment setup.

2. Installing developer tools on the Secure Shell (git, terraform, and kubectl) for use in envinroment setup.

3. Two Linode Kubernetes Engine (LKE) Clusters, each deployed to a different Linode region, provisioned via terraform.

4. Deploying an NGINX container to each LKE cluster, and exposing an HTTP service from this deployment- this container includes static HTML content that at-present runs a browser-based Asteroids game.

5. Applying Akamai Delivery, Security, and other advanced features in front of these clusters, including Global Traffic Management, Site Failover, and Visitor Prioritization.

### Build a Secure Shell Linode
![shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19197357/184126449-454162f9-142f-47e6-ab73-3f1da5e5f456.png)

We'll first create a Linode using the "Secure Your Server" Marketplace image. This will give us a hardened, consistent environment to run our subsequent commands from. 

1. Login to Linode Cloud Manager, Select "Create Linode," and choose the "Secure Your Server" Marketplace image. 
2. Within the setup template for "Secure Your Server," select the Debian 11 image type. 
3. Once your Linode is running, login to it's shell (either using the web-based LISH console from Linode Cloud Manager, or via your SSH client of choice).

### Install and Run git 

Next step is to install git, and pull this repository to the Secure Shell Linode. The repository includes terraform and kubernetes configuration files that we'll need for subsequent steps.

1. Install git via the SSH or LISH shell-

```
sudo apt-get install git
```
2. Pull down this repository to the Linode machine-

```
git init && git pull https://github.com/ccie7599/chicago-workshop
```

### Install Terraform 

Next step is to install Terraform. Run the below commands from the Linode shell-
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
```
```
 wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
 ```
 ```
 echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
 ```
 ```
  sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install terraform
  ```

### Provision LKE Clusters using Terraform
![tf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19197357/184130473-91c36dfc-072b-43f7-882b-07407d7f2266.png)

Next, we build LKE clusters, with the terraform files that are included in this repository, and pulled into the Linode Shell from the prior git command.

1. From the Linode Cloud Manager, create an API token and copy it's value (NOTE- the Token should have full read-write access to all Linode components in order to work properly with terraform).

2. From the Linode shell, set the TF_VAR_token env variable to the API token value. This will allow terraform to use the Linode API for infrastructure provisioning.
```
export TF_VAR_token=[api token value]
```
3. Initialize the Linode terraform provider-
```
terraform init 
```
4. Next, we'll use the supplied terraform files to provision the LKE clusters. First, run the "terraform plan" command to view the plan prior to deployment-
```
terraform plan \
 -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
 ```
 5. Run "terraform apply" to deploy the plan to Linode and build your LKE clusters-
 ```
 terraform apply \
 -var-file="terraform.tfvars"
 ```
Once deployment is complete, you should see 2 LKE clusters within the "Kubernetes" section of your Linode Cloud Manager account.

### Deploy Containers to LKE

Next step is to use kubectl to deploy the NGINX endpoints to each LKE cluster. 

1. Install kubectl via the below commands from the Linode shell-
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl && sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg
```
```
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
```
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
```
2. Extract the needed kubeconfig into a yaml file from the terraform output to manage the first cluster.
```
 export KUBE_VAR=`terraform output kubeconfig_1` && echo $KUBE_VAR | base64 -di > lke-cluster-config.yaml
```
3. Define the yaml file output from the prior step as the kubeconfig.
```
export KUBECONFIG=lke-cluster-config.yaml
```
4. You can now use kubectl to manage the first LKE cluster. Deploy an application to the LKE cluster, using the deployment.yaml file included in this repository.
```
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```
5. Next, we need to set our certificate and private key values as kubeconfig secrets. This will allow us to enable TLS on our LKE clusters. 

NOTE: For ease of the workshop, the certificate and key are included in the repository. This is not a recommended practice.
```
kubectl create secret tls mqtttest --cert cert.pem --key key.pem
```
6. Deploy the service.yaml included in the repository via kubectl to allow inbound traffic.
```
kubectl create -f service.yaml
```
7. Validate that the service is running, and obtain it's external IP address.
```
kubectl get services -A
```
This command output should show a nginx-workshop deployment, with an external (Internet-routable, non-RFC1918) IP address. Make note of this external IP address as it represents the ingress point to your cluster application.

8. Deploy the application to the second LKE cluster. First, delete the existing kubeconfig and re-generate a kubeconfig file for the second cluster.

```
 rm -f lke-cluster-config.yaml | export KUBE_VAR=`terraform output kubeconfig_2` && echo $KUBE_VAR | base64 -di > lke-cluster-config.yaml
```
9. Deploy an application to the second LKE cluster, using the deployment.yaml file included in this repository.
```
kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
```
10. Deploy the service.yaml included in the repository via kubectl to allow inbound traffic.
```
kubectl create -f service.yaml
```
11. Validate that the service is running, and obtain it's external IP address.
```
kubectl get services -A
```
As with the first cluster, record the external IP of the service for the 2nd cluster. 

### Summary of Linode Provisioning 

With the work above done, you've successfully setup redundant clusters in multiple linode regions, and deployed an endpoint application to each. The subsequent Akamai-centric steps in this workshop will use these deployments in various ways, depending on the use case.

- As an alternate origin for site failover cases.
- As a waiting room application for Visitor priorization.
- To demonstrate Global Traffic Management capability for various multi-oriign scenarios (failover, load-balancing, performance, custom routing, geo-map, etc.).
